### Must-haves
- **(UI)** better visual presentation of connected/not connected
- **(backend)** improve backend handling of block devices to avoid the 'hey here are three devices named the same, pick the correct one!" problem
- **(UI)** simple way to have favorite/recent (explore with users) qubes per device and globally
- **(security)** expose policy settings (expand on Global Config tool?)

### Nice-to-haves
- automount / 'wizard' for certain device classes:
  - block devices
  - camera + microphone pair
- sorting
- autostart for sys-usb

### Plan
1. initial Figma design
2. 3-4 user interviews, iterate on design
3. (parallel to 1-2) implement needed backend changes
4. implement Gtk frontend
5. testing, testing, testing
