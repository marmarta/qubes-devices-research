User feedback and proposals based on existing Devices Widget:
- multiple requests for a Recent (as in, recent qubes for a given device) feature
- multiple requests for a Favorites (qubes per device/qubes globally) feature
- automount block devices/other automagical ways to make things 'just work'
- some option for a 'attach persistently' (to skip the pain of doing it via settings from a completely different device)
- better visual differentiation of currently attached/not attached
- more sorting - by qube, by device
- start sys-usb automatically
- when detaching, unmount/warn automatically
- painful use of USB devices
- camera + microphone go in tandem
